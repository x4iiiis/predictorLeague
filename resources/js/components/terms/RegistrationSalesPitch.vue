                Predictor League is getting <em>serious</em>.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <small>2019/20 was a rushed / work-in-progress season disrupted by that pesky COVID bastard.</small>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <small>2020/21 was more of a finished product so we ramped up the number of players, but it was still hindered by the 'rona.</small>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This year, winner takes all.

                Effective from the end of the 2020/21 season, Predictor League participants will pay a small entry fee to create the 
                Predictor League prize pool.
            </p>

            <table class="table">
                <tr>
                    <td class="w-50 text-right">Sort Code:</td>
                    <td>04-00-04</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="w-50 text-right">Account Number:</td>
                    <td>92581590</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p>
                When sending your entry fee, put your name / email as the reference so I know whose account to activate.
            </p>

            <p>
                The money will be safely stored into this Monzo pot, waiting to be released at the end of the season.
